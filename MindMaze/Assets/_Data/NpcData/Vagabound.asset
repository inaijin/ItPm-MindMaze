  dialogLines:
  - Lost, are you? Funny thing, to be lost in a place you built yourself.
  - "Keys, you say? Ah, those are more than tools. They\u2019re fragments of what
    you\u2019ve forgotten."
  - "The maze twists, but it\u2019s not the walls that bind you\u2014it\u2019s what
    you carry within."
  - "Some cracks don\u2019t need fixing. Light gets in through those, you know."
  - "You\u2019re not alone here. You leave pieces of yourself in every shadow you
    pass."
