  - "You think the enemies here are fierce? Venture further, and you\u2019ll find
    out what real battles look like."
  - The further you stray from where you began, the darker the shadows become.
  - "A true warrior doesn\u2019t shrink from the storm. They press forward, even
    as the winds howl."
  - Strength is earned, not given. The greatest tests lie far from the safety of
    where you started.
  - "The harder the battle, the greater the glory. Do not fear what lies ahead\u2014fear
    standing still."
