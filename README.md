# Procedural Dungeon Adventure

## Overview
Procedural Dungeon Adventure is a 2D top-down action game that combines procedurally generated dungeons, intense combat, and exploration. Each dungeon is uniquely generated with randomized layouts, enemies, lights, and treasure, ensuring a fresh experience every time you play.

## Features
- **Procedural Dungeon Generation**: Randomly generated dungeon layouts using Simple Random Walk algorithms.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Torches are dynamically placed in dungeons for immersive lighting effects.
- **Combat System**: Engage in combat with enemies using powerful weapons and abilities.
- **Enemy Spawners**: Enemies spawn dynamically from pre-defined points in each dungeon.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Easily tweak dungeon parameters such as size, enemy count, and lighting frequency.
- **Unity 2D**: Built entirely using Unity's 2D tools and physics system.

## Gameplay
- Explore procedurally generated dungeons filled with torches and enemy spawners.
- Fight waves of enemies using various weapons.
- Survive and reach the end of the dungeon to progress to the next level.
